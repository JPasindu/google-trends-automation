    "During this period, I was assigned two main projects. The first project focused on developing a novel method for calculating the Consumer Confidence Index (CCI) using Google Trends (GT) data. I began by studying the background of the project, including the concept of CCI, the nature of GT data, and existing CCI indices and methodologies used in Sri Lanka. I then reviewed several research papers to understand different approaches for constructing CCI indices, identifing key words that can be used and the methods used for acquiring and preprocessing GT data. I explored GT data extraction using the Pytrends library, identifying challenges such as data-fetching limitations and testing possible solutions to overcome them. In the second project, I was assigned to perform web scraping of the TopJobs website to determine the number of job openings for each job category. I analyzed the website’s structure, identified potential scraping challenges, and initiated preliminary implementation of the web scraping process.\n",
